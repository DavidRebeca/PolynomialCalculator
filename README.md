# PolynomialCalculator
Java application that allows the user to enter data and obtain the results corresponding to the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
integration and derivation on polynomials.The calculator is designed using the MVC architecture and the input is carefully checked using regular expressions. 
I used Java Swing to create the GUI.
